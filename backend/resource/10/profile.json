I was a Straight A's guy, the teacher's pet, the goody two shoes. You can probably tell from my photo as well, my hairstyle, my face, you name it. I might be a dushbag but that doesn't mean you should discriminate against me. Give me a chance. I was always bullied at school, rejected by guys in childhood, rejected by girls in adulthood. Don't reject me now.", "number": 6, "Emotion": "disgust"}
